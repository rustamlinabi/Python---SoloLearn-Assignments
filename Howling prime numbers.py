"""
Howling Primes
A howling prime is a prime number if the sum of its digits is also a prime number.

For Example:
Input:113
Output: true (113 is a prime number, 1+1+3=5 is also a prime number)
Input: 89
Output: true (89 is a prime number, 8+9=17 is also a prime number)
Input: 19
Output: false (19 is a prime number, but 1+9=10 is not a prime number)
Write a program to check if the user input is a howling prime or not.

BONUS: Print all the howling prime numbers in a given range.
